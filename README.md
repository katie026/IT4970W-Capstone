Over the course of 14 weeks, the SitesMobile team embarked on a project to update the tracking system utilized by Mizzouâ€™s Computing Sites. Our mission was to replace the reliance on Microsoft Forms and Excel Workbooks with a mobile application tailored to streamline the management of student employee tasks and computer lab statuses. This application, targeted at roaming student employees, facilitates essential tasks such as inventory counts, computer cleaning logs, and weekly form submissions. Moreover, it equips managers with the tools to access collected data and review detailed reports for progress tracking, evaluations, and site data. Our project timeline was thoroughly planned, comprising 4 weeks of conceptualization, 6 weeks of development, and 4 weeks of testing and implementation. Each team member assumed responsibility for specific feature development, fostering collaboration for user interface (UI) and backend tasks as required. 

Key objectives included establishing a unified system for tracking employee activities and lab statuses, integrating a dynamic remote database (Firestore) for efficient data storage, and researching viable database options within budgetary constraints. Throughout the semester, we successfully implemented the core features of our minimum viable product. Users can now authenticate themselves, utilize live location and map functionalities, submit productivity forms (such as supply counts and computer cleanings), create, assign, and resolve issues, view lists of buildings and sites, and access submitted reports. Additionally, the application allows users to add and remove images, enhancing the overall user experience and data management capabilities.
